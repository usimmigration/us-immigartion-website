							number, email address and card information. Your information is

							<strong>Cookies</strong>
							<br />A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s
							computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site.
							We do not link the information we store in cookies to any
							personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.
							We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use
							session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A
							session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent
							cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.
							You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided
							in your Internet browser’s “help” file or visit our Cookies Page
							for more information. Persistent cookies also enable us to track
							and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on
							our site. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but
							your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or
							surveys, will be limited. With cookies diabled you may not be able

							more information.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Use of Your Data</strong>
							<br />
							The information you voluntarily provide to us is only used to
							process your order. User data is never disclosed to any third
							parties unless as otherwise disclosed in this privacy statement.
							We disclose your personal information as required by law, such as
							to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process when we
							believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our
							rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate
							fraud, or respond to a government request, to any other third
							party with your prior consent to do so.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Links to Other Web Sites</strong>
							<br />
							On our site there are some outgoing links to other sites for the
							purpose of providing visitors with additional information about
							our services and to introduce sites we recommend. The fact that we
							provide these links, however, does not mean that we approve of or
							endorse the content, services or products offered by those sites.
							Should you follow the links, we cannot be held liable for any way
							you may utilise those sites, or for any content they include. When
							visiting the site of any third party provider, we strongly
							recommend you read their terms and conditions thoroughly.
						</p>
						<p>
							In some instances, visitors may arrive at our site via a link
							provided by a third party. In this instance, we cannot be held
							liable for the way the other site is utilised or for its content.
							We recommend you read the site’s terms and conditions thoroughly.
							Any third party sites with links to www.usimmigrationsupport.org
							are not offered by us, and are not within the control of our
							company. In instances where we do link to third-party sites, we
							make every attempt to ensure that those sites are not in violation
							of any legal requirements. However, it is not possible to conduct
							continual or permanent reviews of the status of such sites, and it
							would be unreasonable to expect us to do so. Any links we allow
							are with sites we cannot detect to have been in violation of any
							legal requirements. Should we detect such violations, all measures
							would be taken immediately in order to remedy the situation.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</strong>
							<br />
							If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no
							longer desire our service, you may do the following: correct,
							update, amend, delete/remove or deactivate it, by contacting our
							Customer Service Department: info@usimmigrationsupport.org
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Sharing of information</strong>
							<br />
							The only time we might share your information is if we are legally
							required to provide some user information or individual access
							information related to law enforcement agency, court of law, or
							other government agency in response to their request, subpoena, or
							court order. We do not share your information for any marketing or
							other purpose.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Security</strong>
							<br />
							Our shopping cart includes a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) certificate
							to protect our customers’ information when shopping online. SSL
							technology encrypts the customers’ name, address, and card
							information between your computer and our server. We work closely
							with Visa, MasterCard and American Express to eliminate any
							fraudulent transactions. It is easy to see that your connection is
							secure as the URL of your website will change from http:// to
							https:// indicating that the connection is secure during the
							check-out process. We follow generally accepted industry standards
							to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during
							transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission
							over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%
							secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially
							acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot
							ensure its absolute security.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>The Directive on ePrivacy</strong>
							<br />
							The only time we might share your information is if we are legally
							required to provide some user information or individual access
							information related to law enforcement agency, court of law, or
							other government agency in response to their request, subpoena, or
							court order. We do not share your information for any marketing or
							other purpose.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>The Directive on ePrivacy</strong>
							<br />
							We adhere to the Data Protection Act of 2018, which outlines the
							requirements for companies regarding customer privacy protection
							and the manner in which all personal data is processed.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Changes in this Privacy Statement</strong>
							<br />
							If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those
							changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places
							we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we
							collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we
							disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement
							at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material
							changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by
							means of a notice on our home page.
						</p>
						<p>
							The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulatory
							framework for personal data processing in the European Union (EU)
							and the European Economic Area (EEA).
						</p>
						<p>
							The European Parliament and Council implemented the rule (EU
							2016/79) on April 27, 2016.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>The GDPR’s key goals are to:</strong>
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								provide EU residents more control over data provided to firms
							</li>
							<li>
								provide companies with a framework to follow when processing
								data from EU residents
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Governments outside the EU/EEA exercise various rules on the
							processing of personal data. Some regulatory systems are
							comparable to the GDPR, while others are significantly more
							constrained. Global corporations often adhere to the GDPR
							framework, which is regarded as a leading standard for data
							processing. The internet is made up of millions of websites, each
							of which requires certain data to be placed on the computers of
							visitors.
						</p>
						<p>Data saved can be classified as follows:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Traceable</li>
							<li>Non-Traceable</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							This website does not require any traceable data to be saved on
							the computers of visitors in order to work properly. Visitors are
							fully anonymous. The only non-traceable data gathered is for
							technical analysis. To secure data transfers to and from our
							website, we use SSL (secure socket layer).
						</p>
						<p>
							Only visitors who contact us submit traceable data. What you write
							in your email or online chat and include is entirely up to you. If
							you contact us, we will have access to the information you submit.
							After we respond to your email, it will be permanently erased
							along with any attachments you may have included after 60 days.
						</p>
						<p>
							We do not keep any personally identifiable information for any
							reason other than offer our services and respond to your
							questions. This website is designed for visitors who are at least
							18 years old.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you have any queries about GDPR or privacy, please contact the
							Data Protection Officer at any time:{' '}
